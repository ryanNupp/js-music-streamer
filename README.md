# music-streamer
Self-hosted music streaming service. Host backend on your own server, use frontends to connect and stream your own music files as you please.


IDEA:

overall focus: allow people to install the backend server on their own computers as they please,
use our frontend apps to connect to their own hosted server


Backend:

- Host the server
- Take connections, serve music files
	- Stream them somehow
- Find music files in the local server computerâ€™s 
- pull data from some free online music database, place in a local database or smth
	- album art
	- genres
	- etc.


Frontends:
- Look cool and play music
- play/pause
- scrub through any point in the song


use that data to group by artists, genres, alphabetically, etc.


- *** web frontend (from browser) ***

consider: 
- electron app?? using the same code tbh
- iOS app
- Android app
